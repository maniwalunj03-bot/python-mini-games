# Python Mini Games 🎮

A collection of beginner-friendly Python console games created while practicing core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and user input.

## ✅ Included Games
| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Hangman | Guess the hidden word before you run out of lives |
| Rock–Paper–Scissors | Play against the computer with score tracking |

## 🛠️ Tech Used

What I Learned

While building these mini games, I strengthened my understanding of:

✅ Python basics (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)

✅ User input handling and validating inputs

✅ Random module usage for computer choices

✅ String manipulation (updating letters in Hangman)

✅ Game logic design and handling win/lose outcomes

✅ Tracking scores and attempts using counters

✅ Writing clean, readable, beginner-friendly code

✅ Uploading and organizing a project on GitHub

These small projects helped me apply programming concepts in a fun way and build confidence before moving into advanced topics like data science, ML, and PyTorch.
